# graph

An oversimplified way to illustrate graph data. Useful when the relations and their type are the vital part of the graph.

Lib now contains naive and above all unbounded ways to travel the graph. So plenty of ways to shoot yourself in the foot!

## future

Kind on the Node and Relation became a bit of an after thought. And might go away in the future. A base version of the graph and all traversal and stuff without the relation type could also worth looking into.
